          <p>
            Ferrets are playful, active, curious and loving. They are great
            pets, but before you fall in love with one at the pet store and rush
            out to buy one, there are a few things to consider and especially to
            understand what you are getting into. Ferrets usually live about 6-8
            years on average. The oldest ferret we knew lived to be 11 years old
          </p>
          <p>
            The male ferret tends to be larger than the female, the length of
            the male is around 15-16 centimeters and weighs 2-3.5 kilograms (if
            the ferret is not neutered, it can even reach a weight of 4
            kilograms). The female usually weighs around 0.75-2.5 kilograms and
            is about 13-14 centimeters long. Ferrets' sense of smell and hearing
            are highly developed, but their sense of sight is lacking.
          </p>
          <p >
            Ferrets are animals that like to sleep, it is not uncommon for a
            ferret to sleep around 18 hours a day. In fact, this is an animal
            that is usually active at dusk or at sunrise, but with growth - your
            ferret will get used to your waking hours and adapt.

          <p>
            Raising ferrets is relatively simple, they don't need long hours outside the cage to exercise and they like to sleep for most of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            They will do fine if you leave them enough water and food for two days without leaving the cage and they are also suitable for people who spend long hours at work and come back relatively late
