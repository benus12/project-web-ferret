                    <div class="accordion-body">In general, ferrets have 2 types of fur - thick fur for winter and lighter fur for summer. Ferrets change their fur in autumn and spring. Usually, fur replacement is not accompanied by baldness, itching or other clinical signs. In situations of hormonal problems such as an overproduction of the adrenal gland, many sex hormones are released, causing the ferret to lose its fur, mainly on the sides of the body, accompanied by severe itching, to the point of forming Baldness, in addition - there are other signs such as swelling of the genitals, difficulty urinating in males due to the enlargement of the prostate and more.</div>

                    <div class="accordion-body">Ferrets in the wild must mate every heat, starting at 4-6 months of age. Mating leads to a chain of hormonal processes and ovulation. A ferret that does not mate during heat, does not ovulate - a condition that causes the level of the estrogen hormone in the blood to increase greatly and remain at a high level. The estrogen hormone at a high level in the blood is very toxic in ferrets and causes damage to the bone marrow, stopping the production of red blood cells and severe anemia to the point of death. Sterilization at the age of 4 months prevents this risk.</div>

                    <div class="accordion-body">Ferrets, by their very nature, have scent glands that they use to mark territory. The glands produce a substance with a strong smell, which is released when they are under pressure, similar to stink. The scent glands cannot be removed from ferrets, but the smell can be reduced by neutering the ferret.</div>

                      <div class="accordion-body">Ferrets are purely carnivores with a short digestive system and therefore need food with a high protein level (at least 34%) and of high quality and fat level (at least 20%). It is important that the preservative in the food be of a natural type such as vitamin E and that the food be without food coloring. Today there are types of dry food specific to ferrets on the market. If dry food for ferrets is not available, dry food can be given to kittens, although it sometimes contains too much fiber and sometimes not enough high-quality protein. It is also recommended to enrich the ferret's diet with a supplement containing fatty acids.</div>

After that, the adult ferret must be vaccinated once a year. In addition, we recommend providing preventive treatment against worms once every six months.
